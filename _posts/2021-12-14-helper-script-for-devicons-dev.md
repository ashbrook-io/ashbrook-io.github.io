  because copy/paste is too painful!

I got tired of copying/pasting while adding [devicons](https://devicon.dev/) to my GitHub profile page recently, so I created this little helper script so I could just click on the icons and it would generate some markup for me.

### Some more history on this:
Recently, I 'discovered' that I could add a README.md to my GitHub profile page. I'm quite late on this 'discovery' only coming across it when I went to [someone's profile page](https://github.com/dfinke) and they had a lot of cool things there.

A handful of youtube videos later and I was ready to spin one up. I wanted to add some icons for the dev items and came across [devicons](https://devicon.dev/) which had a ton of great icons I could include via CDN.

This was fine, but since I wanted to simply add the img tag, I had to select an icon, go over to the left side, then copy and paste the img tag which wasn't really convenient setup to do this. See below for a dramatic recreation of this activity!

Now, since I was fiddling around with formatting and things, I ended up going back and forth and back and forth while I figured out which icons I wanted to use, etc.

After a bit, I decided that this was kind of a pain and I wished I could just click on the icons I wanted and copy and paste some markdown. So I put together the little js above and ran it in my browser console. It could be tweaked a lot, but as with all things like this, [it may not be worth it](https://xkcd.com/1205/).

I actually ended up just kind of hand tweaking things on my file rather than using this too much, but it helped me while I was fiddling around, so maybe it'll help someone else! =)
